# Data-Cleansing

Heart disease, alternatively known as cardiovascular disease, encases various conditions that impact the heart and is the primary basis of death worldwide over 
the span of the past few decades. It associates many risk factors in heart disease and a need of the time to get accurate, reliable, and sensible approaches to make 
an early diagnosis to achieve prompt management of the disease. Machine learning is a commonly used technique for processing enormous data in the healthcare domain. 
Researchers apply several machine learning techniques to analyses huge complex medical data, helping healthcare professionals to predict heart disease. 
In this project I have a provided dataset related to heart disease, and I have trained the models on basis of supervised learning algorithms as Na√Øve Bayes, 
decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, SVM, and random forest algorithm etc.

## Project Task
Performed a classification on provided dataset of Heart Attack prediction. For that prediction, first of all I have preprocessed dataset 
(handle missing data, irrelevant data removal, noise removal etc.) and convert it into appropriate numeric form. Then I have performed Machine Learning 
model for the prediction of Label. Exploratory Data Analysis was also done.


## Dataset files Description:
<strong> X_Train.csv: </strong> It contains all Training Dataset on which ML model is built.  
<strong> X_text.csv: </strong> It contains total Test Dataset on which ML Model tested.  
<strong> Y_train.csv: </strong> It contains all Training Dataset label.
